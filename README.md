🎵 Machine Learning-Driven Musical Chord Detection
📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on using machine learning to detect and analyze the chord progressions in a song. The goal is to help musicians, music producers, and researchers better understand the underlying structure of musical compositions. By training models on a wide variety of music data, we built a system that can predict chords from input audio with high accuracy.

🚀 Features
🎼 Chord Structure Detection: Automatically identifies chords used in a song, even with complex arrangements.

🤖 Machine Learning Models: Implemented and compared three ML algorithms –

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Random Forest
Each model was trained to classify chords based on extracted audio features.

📊 High Accuracy: Achieved a 96% prediction accuracy on the test set.

🎧 Diverse Music Dataset: Collected and preprocessed a dataset containing chord annotations from various music genres.

🧠 Technologies Used
🖥️ Programming Languages:
Python

JavaScript

📚 Libraries and Frameworks:
Python: pandas, numpy, matplotlib
(Used for data preprocessing, visualization, and model development)

💾 Database:
MySQL (used for storing training metadata and preprocessing information)

🧪 How It Works
Data Collection: A dataset of songs with labeled chords was collected from public sources.

Feature Extraction: Musical features (like pitch, tone, chroma) were extracted from audio using signal processing techniques.

Model Training:

The extracted features were used to train three ML models: SVM, KNN, and Random Forest.

Models were evaluated and tuned for optimal performance.

Prediction: Given a new song input, the trained model predicts the sequence of chords used throughout the track.

📈 Results
Final model accuracy: 96%

Most accurate model: Random Forest (based on test set results)

🎯 Future Improvements
Add real-time chord detection from live audio input

Improve feature extraction using libraries like librosa

Develop a web-based interface for users to upload songs and view chord predictions visually
